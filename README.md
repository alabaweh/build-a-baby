# Build-A-Baby: Where Bias Meets Eugenics

A satirical web application that exposes the absurdities of eugenic thinking through a mock "baby design" interface.

## Project Purpose

This project is a satirical critique of eugenic thinking and pseudoscientific attempts to categorize and rank human traits as "desirable" or "undesirable." By creating an absurd interface where users can "build" a baby based on arbitrary traits, the application highlights how ludicrous such classification systems are.

The app is designed to make users uncomfortable through its deliberately clinical language and arbitrary scoring systems - this discomfort is intentional and meant to prompt critical thinking about real-world biases and discrimination based on similar concepts.

## Key Features

- Ethnicity selection via numerical range (satirizing racial categorization)
- "Cleanliness Index" quiz that absurdly links personal habits to genetic worth
- "IQ Index" test with ridiculous categorizations like "Idiot" and "Imbecile" (referencing actual historical eugenic terminology)
- Physical trait selection with biased commentary
- Partner education/income selection with class-based eugenic language
- "Ancestral Purity Score" satirizing racial purity concepts
- Social Risk Assessment classification
- Final "Baby Passport" that mimics official documentation for eugenic evaluation

## Satire Disclaimer

This application is a work of satire intended to criticize and expose the dangerous pseudoscience of eugenics. The metrics, categories, and language used are deliberate exaggerations of historical eugenic thinking to highlight its absurdity and harmfulness. No actual predictions or assessments are being made, and the app has no predictive validity.
